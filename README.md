# README

This repository was created for hosting my school website showcasing my CWMUN New York 2024 project.

## Description

The site was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. CWMUN (Conference of the World Model United Nations) is an educational simulation where students learn about diplomacy and international relations by role-playing as delegates representing different countries or organizations within UN committees.
